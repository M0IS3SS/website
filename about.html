    <p>My Name is Moises Vences a Computer Science and engineering student at UC Merced, hoping to work as a full stack engineer in the future.
        I am passionate about technology and always looking to learn new things. I have expereince in web dev and am currently learing about Cyber Security.
        Ive worked with Angular, React, and TypeScript, I am also familiar with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and C++. I have a good understanding of how these languages work
        and I am always looking to improve my skills. I am passionate about coding and I enjoy finding solutions to the problems that the code might have.
        I started my coding journey in highschool where I was interning at a local company where I ment their VP of Engineering and he talked me into becoming a software engineer.
        I have always been interested in tech and how it works, so that also helped me decide to persue a carreer in tech. I am currently looking for internships to help me gain more experience in the field and to help me grow as a developer.
